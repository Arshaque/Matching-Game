Languages used in the Project:

	To have a look at our project kindly open the "index.html" file. Matching Game! is a game which tests the ability of a person. Once the game is loaded, you can see that there are two screens divided.  

How to play:

	Once the game starts, the smileys will be displayed on the page. In the left screen there will be one extra smiley. You need to click on that smiley. Once we click on the correct smiley, you will be going to next level. Each level increases the number of smileys present in the game screen.
	There is time limit of 10 secound for each level in which you need to click on the correct smiley. If you haven't clicked the correct smiley or in the time limit, there will be a gameover and your score will be poped as an alert.
